# robotics-traffic-cone-dispenser
In this project I served as a embedded software programmer, worked with two other members to design a robot. The robot can automatically track non-even, curved paths to follow, detect road obstacles of various shapes and deploy small traffic cones to accurately cover the obstacles. The robot is also equipped with user-friendly features such as optional remote control, reading and managing operation records, and instantaneous visual communication of operation status.<br>
